# <Exit from the maze>

## Description

This project is a simulation of a robot navigating through a maze on a grid-based map. The motivation behind building this project was to explore concepts related to pathfinding algorithms, user input handling, and graphical representation of maps and robots.

The project solves the problem of navigating a robot through a maze autonomously or with user input, while avoiding obstacles and reaching the goal efficiently. Through this project, I learned about various algorithms for pathfinding, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), and how to implement them in a practical scenario.
