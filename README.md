# <Exit from the maze>

## Description

This project is a simulation of a robot navigating through a maze on a grid-based map. The motivation behind building this project was to explore concepts related to pathfinding algorithms, user input handling, and graphical representation of maps and robots.

The project solves the problem of navigating a robot through a maze autonomously or with user input, while avoiding obstacles and reaching the goal efficiently. Through this project, I learned about various algorithms for pathfinding, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), and how to implement them in a practical scenario.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Java installed on your system. This project requires Java 17.
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
4. Compile and run the main class to start the simulation.

## Usage

To use the simulation, follow these steps:

- Provide any necessary command-line arguments or user inputs.
- Interact with the simulation interface to control the robot's movement.
- Observe the robot's navigation through the maze and its interaction with obstacles.
